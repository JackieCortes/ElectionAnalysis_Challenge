# Election Analysis (Module 3 Challenge)

## Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. The two people who contacted you, Tom and Seth, have helped you with this develop.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determina the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. The voter turnout for each county.
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8. The county with the highest turnout.

This task usually is done in Excel, but they wanted to automate the task. If it is correct, the development could use for other elections.
The task was done as it was expected, and the result was delivered in the terminal and a text file. Evidence has been included in the repository.

## Election-Audit Results
According to the request, results were categorized to be presented in the terminal after running the Python code and into text file.
